    The unit was created in 2003 by the state as requested by the World Bank which will be under the office of the Accountant General of each state. This replaces the Project Accounting unit/section (PAS) that was in existence. It will also be assisted by the existing projects in the state both financially and in terms of capacity building of the staff for the unit. 
    The PFMU is aimed at the following:-
    <ol>
    	<li>To improve the quality of financial management for the Bank IDA assisted projects.</li>
    	<li>To ensure the provision of required funds in a timely manner.</li>
    	<li>To ensure transparency and accountability in every stage of the disbursement of funds.</li>
    	<li>To minimize delay in credit becoming effective and enhance projects implementation.</li>
    	<li>To locate all financial management functions for all Bank/ IDA assisted projects being implemented by the state including related special accounts to a unit within the office of the Accountant General (O A G).</li>
    </ol>
